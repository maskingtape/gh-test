Starting with {{ site.PROJECT_NAME }}
=====================

If a project has a website hosted on github pages it will have a gh-pages branch.

The project website will either be hosted at dharmafly.github.com/project-name/ or at a custom domain.

All project documentation should be put as markdown pages in the `_posts` directory.
